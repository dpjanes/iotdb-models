iotdb-models
============

Things - semantically described

## Folders
### abstract

A good jumping off point for creating
new Models. Abstract Models don't 
connect to anything, but they have
reasonable attributes and associated
Javascript code.

### ble

Bluetooth Low Energy devices

### feeds

Models that make RSS/Atom feeds
look like things.

### firmata

Arduino / Firmata related Models. 
A lot of stuff to work with 
Seeed/Grove connectors if you have them.

### ots

"Off The Shelf". Models for commercial
devices, such as Hues, WeMos, etc.

### values

Similar to abstract. Models for holding
values, without any particular semantics
associated with theme. For example,
if you just need to work with a
boolean or a color, there's a Model
here for you
